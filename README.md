# Project-Flux

**Description:**

Project FLUX is my personal AI assistant project that I’m currently developing on my own.
My main goal with FLUX is to make a human-like conversational chatbot that can do way more than just talk. I want it to:

Control and edit things on my system
Access the internet
Find useful stuff like game deals
Handle everyday tasks with simple commands

I’ve got many more features in mind, but the ultimate dream is to make FLUX feel so natural that it’s like you’re talking to a real human instead of an AI.

**Future Goals:**

Make conversations as natural and human-like as possible
Add deeper system-level control and automation
Enable secure internet browsing and fetching information
Keep expanding with new features as I learn more
Turn FLUX into a reliable assistant for almost anything I need done

**Notes:**

I know this is going to take a lot of time, dedication, errors, headaches, and learning. But I’m ready for all of it, because building something like this is worth the effort.
